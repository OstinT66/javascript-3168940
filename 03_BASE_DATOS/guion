Create a dark, mystical and ritualistic motion video sequence, cinematic but minimal, suitable for a student-level After Effects project.

Style and mood:
– Dark, occult, symbolic atmosphere
– Ritualistic and mysterious tone
– Minimalist, elegant, not overproduced
– Inspired by rock culture, memory, and ancestral symbolism
– Slow pacing, subtle motion, cinematic grain

Visual language:
– Black and deep gray backgrounds
– Subtle textures like aged paper, smoke, mist, or grain
– Occult and arcane symbols very faint and abstract (not literal)
– No characters speaking, no lipsync
– No flashy VFX or hyper-realistic effects
– Everything should feel symbolic, restrained, and atmospheric

Scene progression:

Scene 1 (concept and origin):
– Dark textured background
– Subtle moving grain or smoke
– Minimal abstract symbols barely visible
– Space in the center for animated text
– Calm, ritual-like motion

Scene 2 (identity and purpose):
– Abstract visual representation of memory and music
– Shadows, light pulses, slow motion textures
– Symbolic shapes related to sound, waves, or vibration
– Background designed to support informational text overlays

Scene 3 (cultural context):
– Slight glitch or distortion effects
– Dark noise, broken textures
– Feeling of loss, distance, or forgotten memory
– Still subtle and controlled

Scene 4 (mission):
– Clean dark background
– Strong contrast
– Minimal motion
– Designed for bold words to appear one by one

Scene 5 (main project – interactive comic):
– Abstract panels or frames floating slowly
– Ink-like transitions
– Graphic, illustrated feeling
– Space for text describing an interactive digital comic

Scene 6 (Kraken legacy):
– Shadowy rock imagery
– Abstract tentacle-like shapes made of smoke or ink
– Concert lights silhouettes, not literal footage
– Dark and powerful but symbolic

Scene 7 (quote moment):
– Calm, dark background
– Focused center composition
– Slight glow or light bloom
– Designed for an emotional quote overlay

Scene 8 (value and closure):
– Minimalist dark background
– Abstract geometric shapes slowly rotating
– Feeling of conclusion and continuity
– Clean space for final slogan text

Technical notes:
– Camera movements should be slow and subtle
– No fast cuts
– No aggressive camera shake
– No ultra-realistic human faces
– Designed to be edited later in After Effects
– Leave negative space for typography

Overall feeling:
A mysterious creative studio presenting itself as a guardian of cultural memory through art, music, and symbolic storytelling.
